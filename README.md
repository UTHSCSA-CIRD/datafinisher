# datafinisher
A script to post-process DataBuilder output into a single analyzable, denormalized table or spreadsheet. I.e. one row per patient-day, one column for each data element that will be treated as a separate variable during statistical analysis (with some accompanying columns for units, modifiers, various flags/comments). Uses lots of dynamic SQL, but all of it within sqlite3

<code>
usage: makesql.py [-h] [--cleanup] dbfile

positional arguments:
  dbfile      SQLite file generated by DataBuilder

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --cleanup   Restore dbfile to its vanilla, data-builder state
</code>
